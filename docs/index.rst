Welcome to LineageOT's documentation!
=====================================

LineageOT is a package for analyzing lineage-traced single-cell sequencing time series. For full details, see our `paper <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.231621v2>`_.

All of the functionality required for running LineageOT is in the ``core`` module. The remaining modules have implementation functions and code for reproducing analyses in the paper.

The source code, with installation instructions and examples, is available at https://github.com/aforr/LineageOT.
